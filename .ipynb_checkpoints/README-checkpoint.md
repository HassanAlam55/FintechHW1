### Analysis and Commentary on Financing 
Robinhood seems to have had a steady stream of fund raising till 2021. There were two events to cover the funds for the requirements for the high trading volume. 

Robinhood seems to have split three of its fund raises into two (E, F, G). I would be curious what the reason was for splitting the rounds. 

Robinhood also seems to have done a small intermediate round (E-1) at 50M. I’m curious about that round. 

## Business Activities:<a name="businessactivities"></a>
<b>Financial problem being solved?</b><br/>
Robinhood is democratizing stock trading by removing the $5-$10 per trade and offering trades for free<br/>
<b>Customer, Market, Competitors, Advantage</b><br/>
Robinhood’s customer are the retail investors who are classified as “Millennials” with an average age of 26. The total millennials worldwide are 1.8 Billion people. There are ~75 Millennials in the US. Robinhood cross subsidizes its trading expense by selling its order book information. This is a plus and a minus. While it allows Robinhood to provide commission free trading, it also makes them vulnerable to cash shortages during events like the high volume trading as was evident with their need to borrow 3.4B to cover expenses in Q1 21.<br/>
<b>Technologies Used:</b><br/>
Robinhood provides web based, iOS and Android apps. It uses Python, React, NGINX, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, Ubuntu, Redis, Amazon EC2, Sass, Django, Redux, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Swift, Go, Kotlin, Memcahced, Django REST framework, Celery, Aiflow<br/>
